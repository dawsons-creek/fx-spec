// CoreMatchers.fs is now deprecated.
// All assertion functionality has been moved to Assertions.fs
// with the new fluent API:
//
// Old style: expect x |> should (equal y)
// New style: expect(x).toEqual(y)
//
// This file is kept as a placeholder to prevent build errors
// and will be removed in a future cleanup.
